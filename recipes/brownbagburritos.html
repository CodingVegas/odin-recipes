    <h1>Brown Bag Burritos</h1>

    <h2>Brown bag burritos are easy to freeze</h2>
    <p>What I like best about this recipe is that, not only is it filling, but it’s also fast. You can have a piping hot burrito in less than two minutes — straight from the freezer. It’s perfect for those times when my husband wants a late-night snack or an easy weeknight dinner.</p>
    <p>These are little too much on the spicy side for my liking (keep in mind that I’m also the girl who likes extra mild salsa!), but my husband loves these. In fact, he was so excited I was making them again this week.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
